# Netflix Clone

For this project, I wanted to demonstrate my React skills by creating a clone of Netflix. To add a bit of flair, I decided to use Styled Components, which is a cool way to style React components.

I also added a straightforward login system using Google's Firebase. This means users can sign in securely and easily.

API used : TMDB API from https://www.themoviedb.org/
